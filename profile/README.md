### About🙋‍♀️ 

Magami Open Sciences (Magami OS) Initiative is a non-profit, open-science AI-for-good research organisation that accelerates drug discovery research for Africans using AI. 
Africa bears the largest burden of infectious and Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs), which simultaneously now receives the least funding. 


🌈 At Magami OS, our approach is divided into 3 thematic fronts, 
* AI Collaboration for Drug Discovery: We partner with African researchers at any stage of drug discovery to leverage AI technology, providing necessary expertise and resources for successful outcomes.
* Capacity Development Training: We offer comprehensive training programs for biomedical researchers, empowering them with AI skills to enhance their research capabilities.
* Open Source Software Development: We create and distribute open source software tools tailored for drug discovery research, ensuring accessibility and innovation for all researchers in Africa.

### Contact👩‍💻
We are always open to connect with researchers working on drug discovery projects in across Africa and always open to exploring collaboration opportunities.
